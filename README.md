# Sample Node.js TDD Workflow

Before even look at the code in this repo, be aware that the point here **is not**
to show the newest revolution in the open source market or a completly new
idea for your daily problems.

No way!

My goal here is to demonstrate a **TDD (Test Driven Development)** very simple
example, trying to document every step, by commiting in every stage of the
development.

So, as you may expect, the _commits history_ and the _diffs_ are far more
interesting than the code itself. Fell free to navigate the history back and
forth many times to see how the code simply borns by making the tests fail
and pass.

The code is intentionally simple. But TDD is all about that too: if I was
going to think the implementation in advance, I would certainly do a lot of
things different. But then I would be putting stuff there that may never be
used at all and complicating the archteture too much, maybe overthinking some
things or being distracted by the _hmm-this-could-be-a-nice-thing-in-the-future_
kind of thought.

Special thanks to [Thiago Alessio], for helping me with this little project and
to always call me back to reality when I was thinking too much and should put
the tests again on the charge.

And who knows, maybe, we can end with something useful from here...
